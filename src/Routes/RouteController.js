1) Public Routes: These are routes which are accessible to both guest and logged in users. 
Example: Landing Page, Privacy Policy etc.
2) Authenticated routes: These are routes which are accessible by guest users mainly for account creation or login. 
These shouldnâ€™t be accessible for logged in users. Example: Login, Sign Up, Forgot Password
3) Protected Routes: These are routes which are accessible only for logged in users.
 If the user is logged in, go on and display the component in question; otherwise, 
 redirect the user to sign-in page.
